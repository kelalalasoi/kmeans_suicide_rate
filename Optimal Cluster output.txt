*** : The Hubert index is a graphical method of determining the number of clusters.
In the plot of Hubert index, we seek a significant knee that corresponds to a 
significant increase of the value of the measure i.e the significant peak in Hubert
index second differences plot. 

*** : The D index is a graphical method of determining the number of clusters. 
In the plot of D index, we seek a significant knee (the significant peak in Dindex
